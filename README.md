This repository contains my C++ implementation of the algorithms an exercises in the textbook <a href = "http://amzn.to/13VNJi7">Algorithms, 4th Edition</a> by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

The official version at <a href = "https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4">https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4</a>
is actively maintained and updated by the authors and only contains the official Java implmentation.
